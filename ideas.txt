Research: the value of policy driven analyis.
With ever-evolving computational methods and increased ease of quantitative analysis that comes with the advent of computational tools and resources, it seems only natural to make data-driven decisions. Data analitics permeates government and industry decision policy and proceedure. But how has this quantitative effort added value to decisions? Data--it would seem--trumps common sense. Some analysis without quantitative support can simply be dismissed at the whim of a decision maker, who can instead opt for the path that "feels" right. But the decision maker might be less able to dismiss analitic input when that input is backed by a complex, computationally intensive analytic product. Complex analysis does not necessitate the analysis is more correct than the experienced decision maker's intuition, but the decision maker cannot adequately argue against
